# Abstraction Logic in Isabelle/HOL

This is work in progress. Its ultimate goal is to formalise Abstraction Logic and its properties as described in 
[*Philosophy of Abstraction Logic*](https://doi.org/10.47757/pal.2) and [*Abstraction Logic*](https://doi.org/10.47757/abstraction.logic.2), using the proof assistant 
[Isabelle](https://isabelle.in.tum.de), and in particular its logic [Isabelle/HOL](http://concrete-semantics.org).

An outline of the current state of the formalisation is available [here](https://github.com/practal/AL-in-HOL/blob/main/pdf/outline.pdf).

The current theories of the formalisation can be viewed [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/practal/AL-in-HOL/blob/main/html/AFP/AbstractionLogic/index.html).
