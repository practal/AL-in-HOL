# Abstraction Logic in Isabelle/HOL

This is work in progress. Its ultimate goal is to formalise Abstraction Logic and its properties as described in 
[*Philosophy of Abstraction Logic*](https://doi.org/10.47757/pal.2) and [*Abstraction Logic*](https://doi.org/10.47757/abstraction.logic.2), using the proof assistant 
[*Isabelle*](https://isabelle.in.tum.de), and in particular its logic [*Isabelle/HOL*](http://concrete-semantics.org).
