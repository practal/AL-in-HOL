# Abstraction Logic in Isabelle/HOL

This is work in progress. Its ultimate goal is to formalise Abstraction Logic and its properties as described in [1] and [2], using the proof assistant 
[Isabelle](https://isabelle.in.tum.de), and in particular its logic [Isabelle/HOL](http://concrete-semantics.org).
